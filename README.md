# Multi-omics single-nucleus analysis of the human orbitofrontal cortex in psychiatric disorders

We used a combinatorial approach merging clinical data with genetic susceptibility to provide new fundamental understanding of the biological basis of these disorders, specifically analyzing gene expression and chromatin accessibility at the single-cell level within the orbitofrontal cortex of 92 postmortem human brain samples.In our comprehensive study, we tackled these challenges by analyzing gene expression and chromatin accessibility at the single-cell level within the orbitofrontal cortex of 92 postmortem human brain samples. Our approach enriches the understanding of these disorders by complementing clinical data with genetic susceptibility. Through single-nucleus (sn) RNA-seq and snATAC-seq, we respectively examined approximately 800,000 and 400,000 nuclei. Our analysis revealed cell type-specific dysregulation related to clinical diagnosis and genetic risk across different cortical cell types.
